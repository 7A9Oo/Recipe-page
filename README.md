## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

in this project i learned how to use media queries so i design first for mobile after that i work with desktop 


 code snippets:

```css
/* media for desktop */
@media (min-width:376px){
    body {
        background-color: var(--stone-100);
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        margin: 30px;
    }
    
    .parent {
        width: 740px;
        background-color: var(--white);  
        border-radius: 20px; 
    }
    .parent .image {
        padding-right: var(--large-padmar);
        padding-left: var(--large-padmar);
        padding-top: var(--large-padmar);
    }
    .parent img  {
        border-radius: 20px;
        
    }
}
/* end media for desktop */
```
